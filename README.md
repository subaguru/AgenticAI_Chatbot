# ðŸ“° AI News Agentic Workflow

An end-to-end **Agentic AI application** built using LangChain, LLMs, and Streamlit to autonomously search, summarize, and present AI news. This project walks through every component â€” from setting up the project structure to building a complete multi-step agentic pipeline with custom nodes and graph execution.
